Hello, my name is Samuel. I'm currently 29 years old and live Georgia. A few months ago, I was inspired by a friend of mine to make a career change, and I decided to give coding a try. I have a math degree, but I'm fairly new to the whole coding thing. In my free time I like to make music, workout, or just chill and watch a movie. I'm looking forward to learning and working along side everyone over the next few months.
